# RND Montezuma's revenge PyTorch

This implementation is based on jcwleo's work. I modified the code and commented each part in order to be comprehensive.

## To run the trained model
I trained RND Montezuma's revenge agent with a Tesla K80 during 21 hours. <br>
```python eval.py```

## To train again the RND agent
`python train.py`
